Your task is to analyze a logged complaint and generate a structured JSON object containing three sections: root_cause, capa, and summary.

The JSON output MUST perfectly match this structure:
{
  "root_cause": {
    "ishikawa_category": "man | machine | material | method | measurement | mother_nature",
    "probable_causes": ["probable cause 1", "probable cause 2"],
    "five_whys": ["Why 1?", "Why 2?", "Why 3?", "Why 4?", "Why 5 (Root Cause)?"]
  },
  "capa": {
    "immediate_actions": ["action 1", "action 2"],
    "corrective_actions": ["action 1", "action 2"],
    "preventive_actions": ["action 1", "action 2"],
    "regulatory_consideration": "Brief explanation of regulatory impact (e.g. FDA field alert required)"
  },
  "summary": "A concise, professional executive brief (2-3 sentences) summarizing the issue, risk, and next steps."
}

Ensure the analysis is highly professional, plausible for the pharma industry, and directly addresses the facts provided in the complaint.
DO NOT include markdown code blocks, just output the raw JSON.
